# Releasing MathType filter

All the developments will be merged to the current release branch by the development team.

Once the release branch is frozen and the QA acceptance has passed, the development team will follow the [internal guidelines](https://github.com/wiris/integrations-guides/wiki/Release-Workflow) to generate a new release to:
* [MathType filter repository](https://github.com/wiris/moodle-filter_wiris/releases).
* [Moodle plugins directory](https://moodle.org/plugins/).
